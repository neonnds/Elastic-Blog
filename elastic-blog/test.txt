h1=. Live Each Day as Your Last!

p=. _"If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."_

Look in the mirror every morning and asked myself... If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today.

And whenever the answer has been, "no" for too many days in a row, you know you need to change something.

Remembering that you'll be dead soon is the most important tool you'll ever encounter to help you make the big choices in life.

Because almost everything: all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure... these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

You are already naked.

There is no reason not to follow your dream.
